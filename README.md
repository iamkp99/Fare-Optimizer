The big issue concerning the cab rides is the wait involved. More precisely when the customer is booking a ride through app. It takes a lot of time for confirmation as their might not be any driver in that particular area. Our app is concerned about drivers. Sometimes if some driver is new in the city as he/she is unknown about the city then they might not be aware of the regions where he/she can find the customers. So for drivers help our app is aiming about. 
Using data of previous cab rides in that particular city gives the trend of most profitable places. Using K-Means clustering the pickup points in city are clustered so giving cluster centers. These cluster centers are shown in map API in android. Fire base connects systems in modules in project Android with database and database to Machine learning module. Using Random Forest Regression price is projected using previous data of prices. 
Green hotspots are shown on map API using current location of user. On clicking each hotspots predicted price is shown. On clicking marker on map route is directed on Google Map.
